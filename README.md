# ðŸš‰ QR Code Train Entry System

This project is a simple but effective **Train Entry System** using **QR Codes**. Every passenger is issued a unique QR code token that acts as their digital entry pass. Only passengers with valid QR tokens can be granted access to the train platform.

- âœ… Create a **QR code** containing only the token (no personal info exposed)
- âœ… Scan the QR to retrieve and verify the token
- âœ… Validate entry based on token existence
- âœ… City-to-city travel selection with live display
- âœ… Built using **Streamlit** and **qrcode** for fast deployment

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** â€“ Web interface
- **qrcode** â€“ QR image generation
- **OpenCV** â€“ For webcam-based QR code scanning

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Passenger selects** their departure (`From`) and destination (`To`) city.
2. A **ticket id** is generated.
3. A **QR code** is created from that user details and shown/downloaded.
4. At the train gate, a QR scanner reads the ticket id.
5. If the toket id is valid (found in the database), entry is allowed.
